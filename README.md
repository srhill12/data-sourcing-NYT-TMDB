# data-sourcing-challenge

## Purpose:
In this challenge I am taking data from both the New York Times and TMDB to help people find movie reviews and related movies. First, data was extracted separately from both these sources, and then merged together. This was done using API knowledge gained and practiced during class and Module 6 activities.

## Works Cited:
Started code was provided and methods from the activities in Module 6 were used as inspirated and as a guide to completing this assignment.

Xpert Learning Assistant was used particular when implementing the counter.

Online sources include W3 schools for code and Pandas.pydata.org for various arguments that were not explicitly shown in-depth during class.

Throughout my notebook, you may notice comments that I made during initial work, I left them in place in case you need a roadmap into my processes or need to see what I encountered as I worked.

One block of code I got from W3 schools and was shared with my TA during a Saturday extra study session. It was employed due to an issue I was encountered where function provided by started code was telling me that data was already a string. I will leave in place, but commented out.
